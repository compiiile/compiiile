# Deploy Compiiile :rocket:

You own your Markdown files, so unlike a proprietary solution, you can deploy Compiiile and make your knowledge-base accessible on the web freely.

Let's suppose you have a folder containing a bunch Markdown files, with sub-folders, without any config file (no `package.json` whatsoever).
It's a breeze to deploy it, so let's dive into it!

## Self-host your knowledge-base :hammer:

### Using Docker

A [ready-to-use Docker file is available on the repo](https://github.com/compiiile/compiiile/blob/master/Dockerfile) and you can
follow the [instructions on the README to build the files](./README.md#using-docker).

### Build static files

Assuming you have Compiiile installed globally (`npm install -g @compiiile/compiiile`), you can run the `build` command with parameters on-the-fly to generate static files.

```bash
compiiile build --title="Hello world!"
```

You'll have all your static files generated in the `.compiiile/dist` folder, ready to be served on your server!

## Deploy your Markdown files on Vercel :globe_with_meridians:

In your project's `Settings` tab, put these settings:
- Framework preset: `Other`
- Build command: `compiiile build --title="Hello world!"`
- Output directory: `.compiiile/dist`
- Install command: `npm install @compiiile/compiiile`

Wait... is this it? Well, yeah, it's as simple as that! Everytime you make a new deployment (via a push to the `main` branch of your repo or via the Vercel CLI),
you'll get your knowledge-base updated. Once again, without even config files! Isn't it beautiful? :open_mouth:

> [!TIP]
> Of course, something similar can be done using `Netlify`, `GitHub pages`, or whatever you use.
